# restart.py
This repo contains a Python script that restarts a specified `.py` file. If no file is provided as an argument, the script searches for the first `.py` file in the current directory and runs it.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or newer

## Usage Instructions

1. Copy the `restart.py` file to the directory where you want to use the tool.

2. Run the script, passing the path of the `.py` file you want to restart as an argument:
   ```bash
   python restart.py <file_path>
   ```

For example:
```bash
python restart.py my_script.py
```
